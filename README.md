# Storyblok quick starter project

Welcome to this sample project for Vue!
This project serves as a quick starter for integrating Storyblok, a headless CMS, into your web development projects.

For starting, you can access to the `luenglish` folder.
In the folder you have some files like:

- `src/main.js`: the configuration with Storyblok API;
- `src/pages/Home.vue`: the initialization of the Storyblok Bridge.
